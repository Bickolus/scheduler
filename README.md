# Assignment 05: Work Day Scheduler

## My Task

The assignment objective is to create a simple calender application that helps users keep track 
of events for each work hour. The assignment should:

1. Display the current date at the top of the application
2. Have timeblocks for the standard business hours (9am-5pm)
3. Timeblocks need to be color coded to indicate that the time is past, present, or future
4. Timeblocks need clickable text area where the user can enter text
5. Timeblocks need a save button next to them to save the data that the user has entered for that hour
6. The saved data needs to persist, so it must be stored in the local storage

I am glad some of the HTML and custom CSS styling was already given. It made it so I only needed to focus on the
JavaScript and the implementation of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js.
